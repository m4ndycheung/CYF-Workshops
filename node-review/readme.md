## Questions

You run the command `npm start` inside this directory, then

a) what will the first `console.log` starting with "Log 1..." print to the terminal? Explain your answer
So we thought that the console.log would print "LOg 1: function" because express can be called as we can see in line 6. we know this because it's written as express() with smooth brackets.
b) what will the second `console.log` starting with "Log 2..." print to the terminal? Explain your answer.
this one, server is decalred as avariable that equals express(). WHen we hovered our mouse over express(), DOUglas told us the type is actually Express. HOwever, typeof is too basic to know that type, so it returns FUnction.
